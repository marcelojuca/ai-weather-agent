## Training & Learning Path

This project includes comprehensive training materials for learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) with AI Agents.

**For AI Agents & New Contributors:**
- Start with `training/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - This file contains the current training state and progress
- Then read `training/current-training.md` - The main interactive learning guide
- Check `training/training-topics.md` - Complete curriculum blueprint for all 8 modules

The training is designed to be picked up seamlessly across sessions. Each AI agent can read `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` to understand exactly where training left off.

**Current Training Status:**
- Module 1: ✅ Completed (The Big Picture)
- Module 2: 🔄 In Progress (Hands-On with Development Tools)
  - Lessons 2.1-2.6: ✅ Completed
  - Lessons 2.7-2.10: ⏳ In Progress (pytest-watch)
