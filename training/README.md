## How to Use These Files

### For the Student (You)
1. **Start with** `current-training.md` - This is what you're learning NOW
2. **Read the lesson** carefully
3. **Run the commands** shown to you
4. **Answer the understanding check** at the end
5. **When done**, I'll update `current-training.md` with the next lesson

### For the AI Assistant (Claude)
1. **Read** `training-topics.md` to understand the complete curriculum
2. **Reference** `current-training.md` to see what's been covered
3. **Update** `current-training.md` with new content after each section
4. **Check understanding** before moving to next module
5. **Adjust pacing** if student is confused (reference `context.md`)
6. **CRITICAL: Update `current-training.md` after every lesson** - Document:
   - Student's answer to understanding checks
   - Evaluation of their understanding (✅ PASSED or needs more work)
   - Mark the lesson/section as COMPLETED
   - Update progress indicators (✅, 🔄, ⏳)
   - Update "Quick Jump Navigation" at the top
   - Update "Session Progress" section at the bottom
   - Prepare next lesson content in the file so student sees it when they return

## Session Structure

### Each Session Follows This Pattern:

```
1. READ: current-training.md (see what's being taught)
2. LEARN: Read the lesson carefully
3. PRACTICE: Run all commands shown
4. CHECK: Answer the understanding check question
5. UPDATE: current-training.md gets updated with your answer & next lesson
6. MOVE ON: To next lesson when understanding is confirmed
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### What's a "Module"?
A major topic area (e.g., "LangGraph", "Testing", "Deployment")

### What's a "Lesson"?
A specific skill within a module (e.g., "Creating Nodes", "Writing Good Tests")

### What's an "Understanding Check"?
A question I ask to confirm you really understood the lesson before moving on

### What's an "Activity"?
A hands-on exercise where you actually write code or run commands

---

## Progress Tracking

### As You Complete Each Module:

The `current-training.md` will be updated with:
- ✅ What you've completed (marked as "COMPLETED")
- 🔄 What you're currently working on (marked as "IN PROGRESS")
- ⏳ What's coming next (marked as "PENDING")

This way, you can always:
1. Pick up exactly where you left off
2. See what you've accomplished
3. Know what's next

---

## If You Get Stuck

### Reference the Files in This Order:

1. **Stuck on current lesson?** → Re-read `current-training.md`
2. **Want more explanation?** → Check `context.md` for deeper dive
3. **Confused about big picture?** → Check `training-topics.md` for context
4. **Have questions?** → Ask the AI assistant (me) - I'll adjust the explanations

---

## Example: Your First Session

**Your task**: Complete Module 1 - The Big Picture

**What you do**:
1. Open `current-training.md`
2. Read Lesson 1.1: What is TDD?
3. Read Lesson 1.2: What is an AI Agent?
4. ... (read all 7 lessons)
5. Read the understanding check question at the end
6. **Answer**: "TDD means Write tests first, code second, then improve. It's better because you know your code works before shipping."

**What I do next**:
1. Check if your answer shows understanding
2. If yes: Update `current-training.md` to mark Module 1 complete
3. If yes: Add Module 2 content to `current-training.md`
4. If no: Explain more or re-teach the concept

**Next session when you return**:
1. You open `current-training.md`
2. See: "✅ Module 1 COMPLETED"
3. See: "🔄 Module 2 IN PROGRESS: Hands-On with Development Tools"
4. Pick up right where you left off!

## Important Notes

### For Future Sessions

- **Always start by reading `current-training.md`**
- It shows exactly what's been covered
- It shows exactly where you left off

### For Any AI Assistant Taking Over

- `training-topics.md` = THE PLAN (complete curriculum)
- `current-training.md` = THE PROGRESS (what's been taught vs what's next)
- `context.md` = THE REFERENCE (detailed explanations)

**Always check `current-training.md` FIRST to know where the student is!**
